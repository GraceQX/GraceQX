- 👋 Hi, I’m @GraceQX
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics and all kinds of sports. Love making videos and animation, but a professional procrastinator. Also into design and handcraft, if that counts as a hobby. Btw, know a bit coding. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ in COMP 2011 in HKUST
- 💞️ I’m looking for a partner to learn programming together.
- 📫 How to reach me IG: @call_me_your_name
